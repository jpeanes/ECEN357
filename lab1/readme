The https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO/ website, download and install the Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE.

From https://Energia.nu/ website, download and install the Energia IDE. (NOTE: Due to a bug in the IDE, the later versions of the MSP430 Board Library will NOT compile to your MSPFR2355 board. Therefore you have to select Version 1.0.4 over the MSP430 Board Manager to reinstall. Pull up the Board Manager window by choosing Board: "MSP-EXP430FR2355LP"->Board Manager...  from the Tools menu. Then install Version 1.0.4 accordingly)

Read the description of each IDE given on their respective web pages at the links above.

Compile, upload, and run the "Blink LED" example given for each IDE on your MSP-EXP430FR2355LP (MSP430 LaunchPad) board. 
  Observe the results in each case.
  Try to modify one of the programs, such that it has the same blink rate as the other program. (Visual time estimation is fine here)

Referring to the CCS Blink LED Program only, answer the following questions:
  Specifically, how does the program exhibit the use of the I/O aspect of a computer systems?
  Specifically, how does the program exhibit the use of the CPU aspect of a computer systems?
  Specifically, how does the program exhibit the use of the Memory aspect of a computer systems?

Answer the following questions related to the comparison of the two programs (and IDEs).
  What were the sizes in bytes of the Blink programs generated by each of the IDEs?
  Explain the changes that you made to either or both of the programs so they could exhibit the same blink rate.

To Turn in Individually:
  The answers to the questions in Parts 5 and 6 above. (5pts per question)
  The code that you modified for matching the blink rates (include code comments). (5pts for the code upload)
