1) Please review the video link entitled "MKII Buttons and Leds Tutorial" (See link above this assignment)
2) Verify that your device is working properly using the Energia code below:

/*
  Buttons & LEDs example for Educational BoosterPack MK II
http://boosterpackdepot.info/wiki/index.php?title=Educational_BoosterPack_MK_II
 
 Turns on and off Green & Blue light emitting diodes(LEDs) 
 connected to digital pins 38 & 37, when pressing pushbuttons
 attached to pins 33 & 32.
 
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground 
 * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +3.3V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

int buttonTwoState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton #2 status

  } 
  else {

}
3) Upload a short video demonstrating that you can generate the color sequence as indicated in the code by pressing push button #1 and also show that you have control over the RGB when you press pushbutton #2
