Energia is the easiest to use since it's a higher level language modeled after C++/Arduino and is more abstracted. It is straight forward to set the time since the language recognizes time as a unit. Energia code is less efficient than C and asm. C is not as low level as assembly and easier to understand, and is more efficient that Energia. I believe C is able to be implemented on different hardware/dev boards than assembly, I've never used assembly outside of this class but with experience using micro controllers and small general purpose computers I have never seen an option to write or run assembly code. Asselbly is the most efficient using the least amout of flash to do the same thing, but is incredibly not intuitive (for me). The assembly used here is specific to the MSP430xxxxx and I believe would have to be re-written to port to different hardware.
